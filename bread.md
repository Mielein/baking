# Basic Bread (non-sourdough)

## Dough

| Ingredient | Amount | Amount% |
|-|-|-|
| Flour | 500 g | 100 |
| Water (warm) | 330 ml | 66 |
| Salt | 10 g | 2 |
| Yeast | 3.6 g fresh / 1 g dry | .72/ .2 |

Mix dry ingredients.  If using fresh yeast, dissolve in water.
Form a well in your mixing bowl and add half the water.
Mix with a spoon and continue adding water.

If kneading by hand, ensure your hands are wet.  This'll prevent the
dough from sticking too badly.  Continue kneading until the dough stops
sticking altogether.

Cover the bowl and **let ferment overnight**, i.e. about 8 to 9 hours.

## Shaping and Proofing

Place the dough onto your floured work surface and shape the bread
[by folding the dough into itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWXA8xFYu9A).

Place shaped bread into a floured proofing basket or bowl.
Let **proof for an hour** or so.

## Baking

Place a container with water in the oven and pre-heat to **220 °C**.

Score the bread and bake for **25 minutes**, remove the water container
and bake for another **20 minutes**.

Note:  My bread used to be too soft on the bottom or ended up with a
burnt crust.  To remedy this, I like to have the bread on the middle
oven rail for the first baking step and keep the bowl of water on a
lower rail.  After removing the bowl, I'll place the tray with the bread
towards the bottom.  Additionally, I usually pre-heat the baking tray
and slide the baking paper with the bread on it onto the pre-heated tray
once the oven is at 220 °C.

## Flour types

The above recipe should work for a bread with about 4 parts all-purpose
wheat flour to 1 parts rye flour, which is a decent first bread.
Different types of flour will require different amounts of water.
Typically, rye flour requires much more water than wheat flour
and spelt flour is fine with a little less water.
Also, expect to add an additional amount of water if using whole-grain
flours.

In general, just add small amounts of water while kneading until the
dough has a workable moisture.  You can also use this water to keep your
hands wet.
